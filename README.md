## Description
This application is a distributed algorithm for solving the N Queens problem, 
written in C. This software was developed for my third year numerical methods
class, in semester 1 2018. There are two algorithms implemented in this project,
which are the follows.

1. Traditional Best-First Search Algorithm

2. Distributed Genetic Algorithm
